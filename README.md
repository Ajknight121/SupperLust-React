# Requirements

Your system must meet the compatibility requirements for Vite:
- NodeJS installation of version 18+.

The system was tested with node version v20.11.1 and npm version 10.5.2.

# How to Run

Within a terminal, enter the `SupperLust-React` directory.

To access version A, do
```
  $ git checkout premain
```

To access version B, do 
```
  $ git checkout pantry_B
```

When you're ready to run locally, execute
```
  $ npm run dev
```
and go to the locally-hosted webpage whose URL is displayed.

The app may also be viewable at the public URL `supperlust.netlify.app`.  However, the version at this address is currently version B, and cannot be toggled to version A without permissions to modify the contents of the SupperLust-React git repository.
