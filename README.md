# Design Deviations
The map view was removed as its use was redundant when filtering resturants by travel time.
The pantry view was implemented as best as possible
Quick bites was changed to include the meal's name to the user to provide relevant information ealier. 
The quick bites design was changed to better match explore view
The cart page's edit and delete buttons were not shaped and rotated for simplicity for short implementation time.
